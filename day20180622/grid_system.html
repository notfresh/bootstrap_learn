        If you work with Bootstrap's uncompiled source code, you need to compile
        the LESS files to produce usable CSS files. For compiling LESS files into
        CSS, we only officially support Recess, which is Twitter's CSS hinter based
        on less.js.

        Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically
        grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.
